# tacocat-gallery-web-components

Static prototype of the front end of the Tacocat photo gallery website using plain vanilla web components (custom elements, shadow DOM and HTML templates).

This has zero libraries or dependencies; it's plain vanilla standard browser JS + CSS.

## How to use

There's no build or compilation: simply open `index.html` in a browser.  

You won't see much unless you disable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) restrictions.  It's easy in Safari if you have the developer menu installed: just select the 'Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions' menu item.
